1) New Game (complexity shouldnt exceed text)
2:1) Create Character
2:2) Load a saved game
2:3) Choose Pre-set Character (This will be an extra feature for fun and debugging purposes)
  a) Potato - Jacob
  b) Edge - J
  c) Easy Mode - Conner
  if char=a {
    Game will be ridiculously hard and unfair.
    Life stats start out great, but decrease over time, despite whatever happens
    Essentially, choosing this option is suicide- just delayed to the inevitable. 
  }
  if char=b {
    Start out with average stats
    Life stats can be increased, but requires effort and difficulty is often random
    The theme for this idea is that the user will be so worried about wealth and intelligence stats in order to survive, they will almost completely fail out on social stats
  }
  if char=c {
    Literally nothing can go wrong.
    You are the master of everything in your life, you work hard and think carefully and manage to have fun.
    Stats start out mediocre and reach over max in a few short years.
  }
3) Creating a Character
  a)Be able to edit basic, aesthetic characteristics such as (these make only slight differences to gameplay, if any, and are used purely for drawing the player into the game):
    Gender - Male/Female (lol there are only two genders)
    Hair - color/length/style
    Face - shape/skin-color/extra details(scars, freckles, stuff like that)
    Eyes - color
    Body - Height/Thickness (skinny, heavy-set, etc...)/muscularity/etc.
  b)Edit starting stats (everything starts at 5 for balance, and the player is given 20 points to distribute) --whats the limit?
    Fitness - affects combat turn speed, and some events
    Weight - affects 
    Intelligence:;
    Luck:;
    Skills:;
    Life Expectancy (hidden, when years = this, HP = 0):;
  c)Choose a name
